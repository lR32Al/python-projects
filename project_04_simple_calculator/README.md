# Simple Calculator (Function Version)

This Python project performs basic arithmetic operations using a custom calculator function.

## 🔹 How It Works

1. A function named `calculator()` is defined that takes three arguments: two numbers and an operator.
2. The function checks the operator and performs the correct arithmetic operation:
   - `+` → addition
   - `-` → subtraction
   - `*` → multiplication
   - `/` → division (with zero-check)
3. If division by zero is attempted, the function returns an error message.
4. If the operator is invalid, it also returns a warning message.
5. The main program collects input from the user, calls the function, and prints the result.
