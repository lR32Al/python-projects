# Simple Calculator

This Python project performs basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — based on the user's input.

## 🔹 How It Works

1. The program asks the user to enter two numbers.
2. Then it asks the user to select an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
3. According to the chosen operator, it performs the calculation.
4. If the user chooses division and the second number is `0`, the program prevents division by zero and shows an error message.
5. Finally, it prints the result.
